        <h2>How disputes will be resolved</h2>
        <p>
          Subject to the relevant service terms, all disputes arising
          as a result of your use of this Site or on the
          interpretation of these conditions or on any matter which in
          terms of the conditions requires agreement by the parties,
          (other than where an interdict is sought or urgent relief
          may be obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction),
          will upon written request of either party be addressed by
          senior representatives of both parties. The representatives
          will negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the
          dispute on amicable terms. No formal proceedings may be
          commenced until the designated representatives conclude in
          good faith that an amicable resolution of the matter is
          unlikely to occur. Should the representatives be unable to
          resolve a dispute amicably such dispute shall be submitted
          to Arbitration. That arbitrator shall be appointed by the
          Parties and failing agreement shall be nominated by the
          Chairman for the time being of the Chartered Institute of
          Arbitrators (Kenya Chapter) or the National Centre for
          International Arbitration. The arbitration shall be held in
          Nairobi. The arbitration shall be held in accordance with
          the Arbitration Act, 1995 and all other amendments thereon.
          However should the parties fail to settle the dispute
          through arbitration as stipulated above, such dispute will
          be submitted to and decided by a court of competent
          jurisdiction.
        </p>
